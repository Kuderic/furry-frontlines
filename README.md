## ðŸ˜¸ Server

The server code is made using the FastAPI, Uvicorn, and websockets.

The server is meant to be hosted on an AWS EC2 virtual machine, but you can host it on your own machine, too. Just make sure that you open all the ports and connections correctly.

The server can be ran and tested locally using `python main.py`, and then going to `localhost:8000` in a browser. It can also be ran using uvicorn, which will host a dedicated server on the designated ports. Example usage: `uvicorn server.app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`.

See README in server directory for more info.
